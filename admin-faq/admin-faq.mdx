<Accordion title="When I input my email, it generated an Attention Needed error.">
  We typically show this whenever there is difficulty delivering an email to an email address. Check your email and see if there are any emails from hello@intros.ai so we can figure out if we're able to reach your email — some companies and schools have tricky firewalls.

<Accordion title="How do I integrate Zapier?">
  Let's navigate to "Members", "Invite Members", and scroll down to Zapier.

  First, we have to set up your Zap's trigger.

  As an example, we can use Google Sheets and set up our zap to run every time that a record is added to our database (Google Sheet).

  <Steps>
    <Step title="">
      Select Google Sheets as the partner service that we want to use
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select New Spreadsheet Row as the event that we want to trigger this zap
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select your Google account or connect an account
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select the Spreadsheet and Worksheet that you want to connect (this is likely the same spreadsheet that you used in the previous             section)
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  Now, let's test your trigger.

  You should see all of the data from one of the records in your database.

  Next, let's set up your Zap's action. Here, we will define how we insert the data from our database into Intros.

<Steps>
    <Step title="">
       Select Intros AI as the partner service that we want to use
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select Create Member as the event that we want to trigger this zap
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
       Select your Intros account or connect an account
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
       Select the Intros club that you want to create the new member in and map all data from your database to the Intros data fields
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  Take special note of the Creation Mode field. Auto Enroll means that the member will automatically be added to your group (recommended).     Send Invite means that we will send the member a invite email for them to join your group.

  Now, let's test your Zap. You should see success:true and the first name, last name, and email of the member that you added to your intros   club.

  Publish your zap!

<Accordion title="Why did I get an Attention Needed warning when inviting new members?">
  You likely received the Attention Needed warning because of the email had a hard time going through. Emails can bounce due to incorrect email addresses, periodic network failures, or false positives from email security systems. This user is still active, but we may be unable to reach them until you confirm or fix their email address. Navigate to the Members page, select Attention Needed, and correct the user's email, or confirm their email if it is correct.
