<Accordion title="How do I change the time zone?">
  Simply navigate to Club Settings then General Settings to change your club's time zone.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I change my admin email?">
  We can change this on our end — let us know the email you'd like to use and we'd be happy to assist with switching your admin email.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When I input my email, it generated an Attention Needed error.">
  We typically show this whenever there is difficulty delivering an email to an email address. Check your email and see if there are any emails from hello@intros.ai so we can figure out if we're able to reach your email — some companies and schools have tricky firewalls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I add questions to the onboarding form?">
  By adding to the member profile tab, it should also add to the onboarding form.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Which Matching Rules should I use?">
  While we recommend using Matching on Similarity for most questions, visit the "Matching Rules" page to get a better understanding of the benefits of each Matching Rule.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I integrate Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar?">
  By visiting your Member Profile, you can connect Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar to make choosing times for Intros even easier!
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I integrate Zapier?">
  Let's navigate to "Members", "Invite Members", and scroll down to Zapier.

  First, we have to set up your Zap's trigger.

  As an example, we can use Google Sheets and set up our zap to run every time that a record is added to our database (Google Sheet).

  <Steps>
    <Step title="">
      Select Google Sheets as the partner service that we want to use
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select New Spreadsheet Row as the event that we want to trigger this zap
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select your Google account or connect an account
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select the Spreadsheet and Worksheet that you want to connect (this is likely the same spreadsheet that you used in the previous             section)
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  Now, let's test your trigger.

  You should see all of the data from one of the records in your database.

  Next, let's set up your Zap's action. Here, we will define how we insert the data from our database into Intros.

<Steps>
    <Step title="">
       Select Intros AI as the partner service that we want to use
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
      Select Create Member as the event that we want to trigger this zap
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
       Select your Intros account or connect an account
    </Step>
     <Step title="">
       Select the Intros club that you want to create the new member in and map all data from your database to the Intros data fields
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  Take special note of the Creation Mode field. Auto Enroll means that the member will automatically be added to your group (recommended).     Send Invite means that we will send the member a invite email for them to join your group.

  Now, let's test your Zap. You should see success:true and the first name, last name, and email of the member that you added to your intros   club.

  Publish your zap!

<Accordion title="Why did I get an Attention Needed warning when inviting new members?">
  You likely received the Attention Needed warning because the email had a hard time going through. Emails can bounce due to incorrect email addresses, periodic network failures, or false positives from email security systems. 

This user is still active, but we may be unable to reach them until you confirm or fix their email address. 

Navigate to the Members page, select Attention Needed, and correct the user's email, or confirm their email if it is correct.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can you add location to Matching Rules?">
  Yes! The easiest way to go about this is using Tags. We can apply Tags to different members by heading to “Members”, then “Tag Manager” in the top right. Here, we can create Tags for different cities or general locations and apply them to the respective members. Then, when we are ready to schedule an Intro Round, we go to “Intro Round”, then “Schedule Intro Round”, customize our Intro Round, and then select “Continue”. Here, on the “Matching Rules” page, we can head to “Tag Rules” and create rules determining how members match based on their locations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is it possible to edit members once they've already joined the club">
  Admins have the ability to add/manage Tags on members and delete them. Unfortunately, they cannot edit the members’ core information that they either requested through their onboarding process or uploaded ourselves when adding them to the Intros Club. However, Members do have the ability to edit this information themselves.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can members opt-in to more than one Intro Round">
  Yes, members can opt-in to as many Intro Rounds as they'd like!
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between Send Invitations and Send Introductions when scheduling an Intro Round?">
  2. When scheduling an Intro Round, you’ll notice two different dates and times that you must select. 
    1. The first, “Choose Time to Send Invitations”, refers to the initial email asking members to either opt-in or opt-out based on which option you choose when customizing the Intro Round. 
    2. The second, “Choose Time to Send Introductions”, refers to the email sent to members who are in the Intro Round (either they opted-in if you chose opt-in when customizing, or didn’t opt-out if you chose opt-out when customizing) introducting them to their match.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if there are an odd number of sign-ups during an Intro Round">
  If there are an odd number of sign ups, unfortunately the odd person out will not receive a match during that round. However, we’ve built a feature into our backend which guarantees that person receives a match during the next round.
