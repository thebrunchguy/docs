<Accordion title="How do I change my admin email?">
  We can change this on our end — let us know the email you'd like to use and we'd be happy to assist with switching your admin email.

<Accordion title="When I input my email, it generated an Attention Needed error.">
  We typically show this whenever there is difficulty delivering an email to an email address. Check your email and see if there are any emails from hello@intros.ai so we can figure out if we're able to reach your email — some companies and schools have tricky firewalls.

<Accordion title="How do I add questions to the onboarding form?">
  By adding to the member profile tab, it should also add to the onboarding form.

<Accordion title="Which Matching Rules should I use?">
  While we recommend using Matching on Similarity for most questions, visit the "Matching Rules" page to get a better understanding of the benefits of each Matching Rule.

<Accordion title="How do I integrate Zapier?">
  Let's navigate to "Members", "Invite Members", and scroll down to Zapier.

  First, we have to set up your Zap's trigger.

  As an example, we can use Google Sheets and set up our zap to run every time that a record is added to our database (Google Sheet).

  Select Google Sheets as the partner service that we want to use
  Select New Spreadsheet Row as the event that we want to trigger this zap
  Select your Google account or connect an account
  Select the Spreadsheet and Worksheet that you want to connect (this is likely the same spreadsheet that you used in the previous section)

  Now, let's test your trigger.

  You should see all of the data from one of the records in your database.

  Next, let's set up your Zap's action. Here, we will define how we insert the data from our database into Intros.

  Select Intros AI as the partner service that we want to use
  Select Create Member as the event that we want to trigger this zap
  Select your Intros account or connect an account
  Select the Intros club that you want to create the new member in and map all data from your database to the Intros data fields

  Take special note of the Creation Mode field. Auto Enroll means that the member will automatically be added to your group (recommended).     Send Invite means that we will send the member a invite email for them to join your group.

  Now, let's test your Zap. You should see success:true and the first name, last name, and email of the member that you added to your intros   club.

  Publish your zap!
