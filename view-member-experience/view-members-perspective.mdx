Immediate Use Cases for Members
----------------------------------

Right off the bat, members will be able to request introductions to other community members, join an upcoming round of introductions, and change/update their own profile/preferences.

Request Introductions
---------------------

**Connect with a member from Austin, TX**

Suppose I'm planning a trip to Austin, TX next month and want to connect with a founder/VC in the EdTech space.

**Go to the "Filters" tab**

I want to get much more specific in my search, so I'll head to the "Filters" tab.

<Note>
    **Note:** We chose "Hosting a Directory" on the admin panel to give you the perspective when members have the choice to make their own introductions. 

</Note>

**Insert "Austin, TX" under "Locations"**

This should narrow down the search quite a bit. Let's click apply.

**Request an Intro**

Perfect! It looks like David is a good match. He's a former founder and current VC that's interested in the EdTech space. I'll send over an introduction request.

**Send a Personalized Request**

    **Note:** Before the note is submitted to David, you will be able to choose your time slot first. 

</Note>
**Choose a time**

Let's go with Monday the 26th at 5:30PM EST.

**Click send!**

Amazing! Just booked the introduction with the time sent. Looks like the invitation will come in shortly.

Join an upcoming round
----------------------

**Opt-In to an Upcoming Round**

It's been a busy week. Let's join this week's round.

<Note>
    **Note:** We chose "Automated 1:1 Connections" on the admin panel to give you the perspective when members can opt-in to rounds that admins have already made.

</Note>

Change/Update Preferences
-------------------------

**Go to "View Profile"**

![](/images/perspective11.png)

<Note>
    **Note:** If your community member wasn't really paying attention during sign-up, this section allows for them to add changes afterwards. 

</Note>

 **Edit Profile**

**Change Preferences**

Recap
-----

In this section, we outlined how to enhance the member experience on IntrosAI by envisioning the ideal community, enabling immediate use cases like requesting introductions and joining rounds, and collecting member data for personalized connections. We emphasized the importance of a seamless and engaging experience, encouraging active participation and meaningful connections. The next step is to onboard members by collecting their information, allowing them to update it as needed.

Next Steps: Data Collection
---------------------------

Our first step to making this vision a reality is to start by onboarding our members. We're going to do this by sending out a form where they can fill out their information for other members to see and we can collect the right data to match them appropriately.
