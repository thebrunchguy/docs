      <Step title="Utilizing Filters">
        Suppose I'm planning a trip to Austin, TX next month and want to connect with a founder/VC in the EdTech space.

        Go to the "Filters" tab

        <Note>
          **Note:** We chose "Hosting a Directory" on the admin panel to give you the perspective when members have the choice to make                their own introductions. 

        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Locations">
        Insert "Austin, TX" under "Locations"

        This should narrow down the search quite a bit. Let's click apply.

        Perfect! It looks like David is a good match. He's a former founder and current VC that's interested in the EdTech space. I'll send         over an introduction request.
