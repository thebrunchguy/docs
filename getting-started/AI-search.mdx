<Note>
**Note:** You can click the toggle icon on the right side of the page and select "Disabled" if you prefer not to have AI Search, preventing members from using AI to find other members.
</Note>

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip:** You can also write in special instructions for your chatbot, such as tone, response brevity or anything else to customize your member's experience further.

### Member AI Search Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Members to AI Search">
   To share AI Search with your members, add and invite them to the community (or activate them immediately). Then, members can go to intros.club/ai-chat and receive a magic link to login. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Members Type in a Query">
   Below, you'll see an example of a query that one of your members could type in e.g. "I'm looking for founders based in NYC."
   
   Ziv, our chatbot, will return a response using other members in the community.

  <Step title="Members Check Out Profiles">
  Members can click onto member's names to see more information from their profiles e.g. phone number, job title, company, etc.

</Step>
  <Step title="Members Request Intro or More Information">
You'll see here that members have two options: either request an intro with another member where they will type in a message and submit and propose a time to chat, or they can request more information about that person before deciding to connect.

When members request an intro, all they have to do is write in a short personalized message and then hit "Submit and Propose a Time". Once done, it will be marked as "Request Sent".

When members request more information, they will get a more detailed long-form response, including more personal details about this person.
