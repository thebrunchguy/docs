### Member AI Search Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Members to AI Search">
    To share AI Search with your members, add and invite them to the community (or activate them immediately). Then, there are three ways that members can directly access the product:&#x20;

    * **Standard Website Login:** Visit [intros.ai](http://intros.ai/), click "Log In", then sign in as a member using their email & receive a magic link.

    * **White-Labeled Sign-In (Like Techstars):** Click “Already a Member?” on the custom login page (onboarding form), enter their email & receive a magic link.

    Below is an example of a member query: *"I'm looking for founders based in NYC."* Ziv, our chatbot, will return relevant members based on the query.
