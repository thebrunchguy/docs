<Note>
**Note:** You can click the toggle icon on the right side of the page and select "Disabled" if you prefer not to have AI Search, preventing members from using AI to find other members.
</Note>

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip:** You can also write in special instructions for your chatbot, such as tone, response brevity or anything else to customize your member's experience further.

### Member AI Search Experience
To share **AI Search** with your members, add and invite them to the community (or activate them immediately). Then, members can go to intros.club/ai-chat and receive a magic link to login. 

Below, you'll see an example of a query that one of your members could type in e.g. "I'm looking for founders based in NYC."

Ziv, our chatbot, will return a response using other members in the community.

You'll see here that members can either request an intro where they will then type in a message and submit and propose a time to chat, or they can request more information about that person prior to deciding to connect.
