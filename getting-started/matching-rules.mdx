  <Tab title="Match on Similarity">
    Imagine you have a group of members who have indicated their preferences for weekend activities:

   Member 1: Loves hiking, enjoys reading, interested in cooking

   Member 2: Enjoys hiking, loves cooking, interested in photography

   Member 3: Loves photography, enjoys cooking, interested in hiking

In this case, "Match on Similarity" means that the system will pair members based on how closely their preferences align. For example:

Member 1 might be matched with Member 2 because they both enjoy hiking and have an interest in cooking.

Member 2 could also be matched with Member 3 since they both love cooking and have an interest in another shared activity (hiking for Member 2 and photography for Member 3).

This way, members are paired with others who have similar interests, making it more likely that they'll enjoy their time together and form meaningful connections.

  <Tab title="Match with Sub-Groups">
    Imagine you have a sub-group of members who are interested in a specific hobby:

   First Tag: Photography Enthusiasts

      Answer Response 1: Amateur Photographer

      Answer Response 2: Professional Photographer

      Answer Response 3: Photography Student

   Rule: Must Match

In this scenario, the rule "Must Match" means that members within the "Photography Enthusiasts" sub-group will be matched with each other based on their level of experience or interest in photography. So, an amateur photographer might be paired with a photography student to share tips and learn from each other, while professional photographers can connect to discuss advanced techniques and industry insights. This ensures that members are matched with others who share their specific interest, fostering more meaningful and relevant connections.

  <Tab title="Match across Sub-Groups">
    Imagine you have two sub-groups of alumni based on their graduation years:

   First Tag: Cohort 2010

      Answer Response 1: Graduated in 2010

      Answer Response 2: Interested in Networking

      Answer Response 3: Lives in New York

   Second Tag: Cohort 2015

      Answer Response 1: Graduated in 2015

      Answer Response 2: Interested in Mentorship

      Answer Response 3: Lives in San Francisco

   Rule: Can Not Match

In this case, the rule "Can Not Match" means that members from Cohort 2010 will not be matched with members from Cohort 2015 based on their graduation year. However, they could still be matched based on other criteria, such as their interest in networking or mentorship, or their location. This allows for cross-cohort connections while still respecting the boundaries of each graduation year.
