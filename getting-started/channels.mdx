  <Step title="Invite Members">

Head to the [Members](getting-started/members) tab for detailed information on how to invite members to your Slack community.

<Note>
    **Note:** When uploading members data via CSV, make sure to click "Upload without Inviting" and **NOT** "Invite Members" to ensure they don't receive a welcome email because we want them to be on Slack, not email. 

</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Customize Slack Messages">

To do so, navigate to the Channels tab and click on the Slack button to further customize each Slack message (e.g. Welcome, Introduction, Opt-in / Opt-out, etc.).

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip:** Send yourself a test welcome message to check that it's working properly. 
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Invite Uploaded Members">

<Note>
This is how the user will receive the welcome message on Slack. It will automatically enter the name of the person receiving the message.
