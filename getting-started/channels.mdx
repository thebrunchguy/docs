Welcome to the Channels page, where you can edit different email templates, send test emails, integrate Slack, and more. 

---

**Email**

    You can edit invite templates based on the communication channel you choose (e.g. Email or Slack).

    Additionally, you can send test emails to yourself before applying your changes to communication with community members.

  <Step title="Invite Members">

Head to the [Members](getting-started/members) tab for detailed information on how to invite members to your Slack community.

<Note>
    **Note:** When uploading members data via CSV, make sure to click "Upload without Inviting" and **NOT** "Invite Members" to ensure they don't receive a welcome email because we want them to be on Slack, not email. 

</Note>

<Step title="Customize Slack Messages">

To do so, navigate to the Channels tab and click on the Slack button to further customize each Slack message (e.g. Welcome, Introduction, Opt-in / Opt-out, etc.).

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip:** Send yourself a test welcome message to check that it's working properly.

<Step title="Invite Uploaded Members">

This is how the user will receive the welcome message on Slack. It will automatically enter the name of the person receiving the message.
