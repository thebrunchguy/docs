### **Email**

  Under the **Email** tab, you can edit every email template e.g. Member Confirmation, Introduction, Opt-In / Opt-Out, etc.

    **Pro Tip:** You can send test emails to yourself before applying your changes to communication with community members.

  <Step title="Invite Members">

> Head to [Members](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/members) for detailed information on how to invite members to your Slack community.

<Note>
    **Note:** When uploading members data via CSV, make sure to click "Upload without Inviting" and **NOT** "Invite Members" to ensure they don't receive a welcome email because we want them to be on Slack, not email. 

</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Customize Slack Messages">

Similar to email, you can also further customize your Slack messages.

<Tip>
    **Pro Tip:** Send yourself a test welcome message to check that it's working properly. 
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Invite Uploaded Members">

<Note>
This is how the user will receive the welcome message on Slack. It will automatically enter the name of the person receiving the message.
