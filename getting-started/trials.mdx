Welcome to the Trials page, where you can learn how to run a quick trial of Intros AI for your community. 

Check out our step-by-step trial guide below!



<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Admin Account & Setup Intros Club">
   For steps on creating an account, head to the [Introduction](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/introduction) section if you have not already done so. 

  Once you've created a new Intros Club, go to "[Club Settings](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/club-settings)" to begin customizing your time zone, email button colors, and more!
    </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Member Profile, Onboarding and Feedback Forms">
  Now that we've created and white-labeled our Intros Club, we can add in custom questions to our onboarding form by heading to "[Member Profile](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/member-profile)", as well as further customize the onboarding and feedback forms in the "[Customization](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/customization)" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Trial Members">
    Now that the above is complete, we can add ~10 trusted members of our community for the trial run. Head to "[Members](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/members)" and select "Add Members." 
    
    Again, for the sake of simplicity, let's select the "Onboarding Form Link" to copy it to our clipboard. Now, we can directly share this link to the ~10 people we'd like to include in our trial and they'll be automatically added to our Intros Club upon completion of the form.
    </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Directory & AI Search">
   Take some time to familiarize yourself with the member's experience of both the "[Directory](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/directory)" and "[AI Search](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/AI-search)", and determine if you'd like to enable these features for your community. If so, encourage your members to try them out!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule Intro Round">
    Now it's time to schedule our first Intro Round. In your Intros Club, head to "Intro Rounds" and select "Schedule Intro Round". For a walkthrough of the different scheduling flows, head [here](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/intro-rounds). For this trial, let's select the opt-in flow and send invitations one day before introductions. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Insights">
    Strengthen alumni associations by connecting graduates based on their professional backgrounds and current needs, enhancing the value of     the alumni network.
