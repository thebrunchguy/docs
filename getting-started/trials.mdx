<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Admin Account & Setup Intros Club">
   For steps on creating an account, head to the [Introduction](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/introduction) section if you have not already done so. 

  Once you've created a new Intros Club, go to "[Club Settings](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/club-settings)" to begin customizing your time zone, email button colors, and more!

  Follow the process outlined in the "Get Started" flow on the "[Dashboard](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/dashboard)" as well as in the trial guide demo above.
    </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Member Profile, Onboarding and Feedback Forms">
  Now that we've created and white-labeled our Intros Club, we can add in custom questions to our onboarding form by heading to "[Member Profile](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/member-profile)", as well as further customize the onboarding and feedback forms in the "[Customization](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/customization)" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Trial Members">
  When the above is complete, we can add ~10 trusted members of our community for the trial run. Head to "[Members](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/members)" and select "Add Members." 
    
    Again, for the sake of simplicity, let's select the "Onboarding Form Link" to copy it to our clipboard. Now, we can directly share this link to the ~10 people we'd like to include in our trial and they'll be automatically added to our Intros Club upon completion of the form.
    </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Directory & AI Search">
   Take some time to familiarize yourself with the member's experience of both the "[Directory](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/directory)" and "[AI Search](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/AI-search)", and determine if you'd like to enable these features for your community. If so, encourage your members to try them out!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule Intro Round">
   Head to "[Intro Rounds](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/intro-rounds)" and select "Schedule Intro Round". For this trial, let's select the "Opt-in with Scheduling Link" flow and send invitations one day before introductions. 

   Customize your emails within the Intro Rounds flow or on the "[Channels](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/intro-rounds)" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Insights & Reports">
    Use "[Insights](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/insights)" & "[Reports](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/reports)" to track engagement and feedback as well as download data from members to determine how the trial went.
