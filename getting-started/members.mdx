## **Utilizing Tags**

Within the Members page, you can easily create Tags to identify and group certain members of your community. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a Tag">
    For example, if you wanted to view all of the founders in your community as a group, you could create a Tag called "Founder", as shown      below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Active Tab">
    In the active tab, you will see members who have accepted an invite.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Invited Tab">
    These are all of the members that have been invited (through email or CSV).
    > Invites to **opt-in** would go to the Invited Tab.
    > 

    > Invites to **opt-out** would go to the Active Tab.
    > 

    Members that are uploaded will go to the Pending Tab.

    You may also manually activate a member if you don’t want to wait for them to accept the invite.

    > *Pro Tip: In order to do that, click the “check” mark on the actions, then the member will be marked as active.*
    > 
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Pending Tab">
    This tab includes members who have joined via an onboarding form (in the case that the admin has selected "I will manually approve          them" seen in the general settings) or been uploaded from a third party source (e.g. Zapier). 

    Members can be in the pending tab for 2 reasons:

    - The member joined via the onboarding form created by the admin and “manually approve members” was toggled on in the general settings      page.
    - The admin uploaded the members.

    Things you can do in the Pending tab:

    - Approve the member (by clicking the check mark on the actions). The member will then be marked as active.
    - Delete a member (then they will be marked as inactive).
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Inactive Tab">
    In this tab, you will see the members who are inactive.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Questions">
