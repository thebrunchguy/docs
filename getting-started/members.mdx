Within the Members page, you can create Tags to identify and group certain members of your community. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a Tag">
    For example, if you wanted to view all of the founders in your community as a group, you could create a Tag called "Founder", as shown      below.

    > To create a Tag, click on “Tag Manager”, then “Add Tag”, type in a Tag name, and click “Save”.
    > 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using Tags">
    Once you’ve created a Tag, you can apply it to certain users by navigating to the “Users” tab at the top of the Tag Manager. From here,     you can hit the “+” next to any user and select the tag that you would like to apply.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Questions">
    For example, you could use the question "How long have you been at the company?" and the answer "8+ years" to search for people with        deep expertise.

## **Inviting Members**

There are four main methods for adding new Members to your community: uploading existing Member data, sending direct invitations, using an Onboarding Form Link when no data is available, or integrating Member data from another product.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Uploading Member Data">
  Before inviting Members, it’s important to upload any existing Member data (such as emails and names) via CSV if you have it. This ensures that the platform has all necessary information for your Members.

   <Accordion title="Access the Invite Members Tab">
  Navigate to the Invite Members tab and select the Import Participants From CSV File option.
 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="Upload the CSV File">
   Choose the CSV file from your computer that contains the Member data to upload it directly into the platform.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Map Data Types">
   > **Standard Fields:** Map each CSV column to the corresponding Intros Profiles data type (e.g., first/last name, email, phone number, etc.).
   
   > **Custom Fields:** Create custom free-text fields during the mapping process if your CSV contains data that doesn’t fit the standard fields. This allows you to capture specialized information that’s important to your community.
    </Accordion>
       <Accordion title="Preview and Confirm">
    Preview the profiles to ensure all the data is mapped and displayed correctly, including any custom fields.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Manage Uploaded Members">
    > **Activate Without Invitation:** You can upload Members without sending an invitation. These Members will be added to the Pending tab, where you can manually activate them by approving them under the Actions section.
    
    > **Invite After Upload:** If you want to send out invitations after uploading, proceed to the next step.
  </Accordion>
  </Step>
 <Step title="Inviting Members via Email">
 After uploading Member data, you can proceed with inviting Members to join your community via email.

<Accordion title="Access the Invite Members Tab">
  Navigate to the Invite Members tab to start the invitation process.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Invite with Email">
  Enter each Member's email address individually, pressing enter after each one, or select multiple emails at a time to send a direct invitation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Choose an Invitation Method">
   **Opt-in:**
  > Members must click "Join the Community!" in the invitation email to join. They will be directed to complete the Onboarding form.
  
  >The platform automatically recognizes and skips over any information you’ve already collected, ensuring that Members only provide new, unique details.

**Opt-out:**
  > Members are automatically added to the community and can access the Member Directory by clicking "Check out the Community!" in the invitation email.

  > Members can opt out at any time through their Member Profile, the Member Directory, or by clicking "Leave the Community" in the email invitation.

**Invite via Member Directory:**
 > If you’ve already uploaded members, you can also invite them by selecting their names or selecting all within the Member Directory and inviting them directly.
</Accordion>
  </Step>
 <Step title="Inviting Members through an Onboarding Link">

If you prefer a simple and direct approach, and you don’t have any Member data, you can instead invite Members by sharing an onboarding link. This method allows Members to join the community by accessing the form directly, without needing to go through an email invitation process.

  <Accordion title="Customize the Onboarding Form">
  Before sending out the link, you can customize the onboarding form to best fit your community’s needs.

  There are five different types of questions you can create to gather the most relevant information from your Members:

  1. **Free Response:** Allows Members to provide detailed answers in their own words.
  
  2. **Single Select:** Offers a list of options where Members can choose only one response.
   
  3. **Multi Select:** Allows Members to select multiple options from a list.
  
  4. **Custom Scale:** A Likert scale with custom values (e.g., "How many years of experience do you have?"). Custom scale questions must have 5 values.
   
  5. **Two Part Multi:** Give & take style questions consisting of two related questions that share a similar answer bank. For example, "Where could you use support?" and "How can you support others?"
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Copy the Onboarding Form Link">
  > Navigate to the Invite Members tab.

  > Underneath the Invite with Email and Import Participants From CSV File options, you'll find the Onboarding Form Link.
  
  > Copy this link and share it with your Members via iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack, or any other platform.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Preview the Onboarding Form">
  > Paste the link into a new browser tab to preview the Member's onboarding experience.
  
  > This preview allows you to understand the flow from a Member's perspective.
  </Accordion>
</Step>
 <Step title="Inviting Members through Zapier">
 If you want to automate the process of inviting Members from other platforms like Circle, you can use Zapier to create a seamless integration. Though this method may require a bit more setup, it is definitely worth it. 

<Accordion title="Login to Zapier">
  **If you don’t already have a Zapier account:**
  > Sign up for a free account at [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/).
  
  > Follow the instructions to set up your account and familiarize yourself with the platform.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Set Up a New Zap">
  _A Zap is a workflow that connects two or more apps to automate tasks. In this case, you’ll connect Circle to Intros AI._

  **To create a new Zap:**
  > In the Zapier dashboard, you'll see a search bar under the question, "What would you like to automate?"

  > Type in "When a new Member is added in Circle, create a Member in Intros AI" to find relevant pre-built Zaps or to start building your own.

  > You can either click the purple "Try it" button next to a suggested Zap, or you can click "+ Create" in the top left hand corner of the screen to start from scratch.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Set Up the Trigger">
  > Once you’re inside the Zap builder, you’ll start by setting up a **Trigger**—this is what kicks off the automation.

> Choose **Circle** as the app, and for the trigger event, select **New Member Added** (or a similar option).

> Connect your Circle account by signing in and authenticating your credentials.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Set Up the Action">
> Next, you’ll need to set up the **Action** that Zapier should take whenever the Trigger happens.

> Choose **Intros AI** as the action app, and select an event like **Create Member**.

> Connect your Intros AI account in the same way you did for Circle.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Your Zap">
 > Once both the Trigger and Action are set up, Zapier will prompt you to run a test to ensure everything is working correctly.
 
 >This step is crucial for making sure new Members added in Circle are automatically added to Intros AI.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Activate Your Zap">
  > After confirming that your test is successful, you can activate the Zap.
  
  > From now on, any new Member added to Circle will automatically be created in Intros AI without manual intervention.
 </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Viewing Members**

Additionally, you can toggle through different filters or use the search function to find specific members of your community. As shown below, you can sort members by:

![](/images/members-6-optim.png)

---

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Active Tab">
    In the active tab, you will see all members who have accepted an invite.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Invited Tab">
    In the invited tab, you will see all of the members that have been invited (through email or CSV).
    > Invites to **opt-in** would go to the Invited Tab.
    > 

    > Invites to **opt-out** would go to the Active Tab.
    > 

    You may also manually activate members if you'd like to speed up the process.

    > In order to do that, click the “check” mark on the actions, then the member will be marked as active.
    > 
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Pending Tab">
    In the pending tab, you will see all of the members who have joined via an onboarding form (in the case that the admin has selected "I      will manually approve them" seen in the general settings) or been uploaded from a third party source (e.g. Zapier). 

    Members may be in the pending tab for 2 reasons:

    > The member joined via the onboarding form created by the admin and “manually approve members” was toggled on in the general settings      page.
    > 

    > The admin uploaded the members.
    > 
    Things you can do in the Pending tab:

    > Approve the member (by clicking the check mark on the actions). The member will then be marked as active.
    > 

    > Delete a member (then they will be marked as inactive).
    > 
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Inactive Tab">
    In the inactive tab, you will see all of the members who are inactive.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
