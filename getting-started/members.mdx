<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Active Tab">
    In the active tab, you will see all members who have accepted an invite.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Invited Tab">
    In the invited tab, you will see all of the members that have been invited (through email or CSV).
    > Invites to **opt-in** would go to the Invited Tab.
    > 

    > Invites to **opt-out** would go to the Active Tab.
    > 

    You may also manually activate members if you'd like to speed up the process.

    > In order to do that, click the “check” mark on the actions, then the member will be marked as active.
    > 
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Pending Tab">
    In the pending tab, you will see all of the members who have joined via an onboarding form (in the case that the admin has selected "I      will manually approve them" seen in the general settings) or been uploaded from a third party source (e.g. Zapier). 

    Members may be in the pending tab for 2 reasons:

    > The member joined via the onboarding form created by the admin and “manually approve members” was toggled on in the general settings      page.
    > 

    > The admin uploaded the members.
    > 
    Things you can do in the Pending tab:

    > Approve the member (by clicking the check mark on the actions). The member will then be marked as active.
    > 

    > Delete a member (then they will be marked as inactive).
    > 
  </Tab>
 <Tab title="Inactive Tab">
    In the inactive tab, you will see all of the members who are inactive.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
