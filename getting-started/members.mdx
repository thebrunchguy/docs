## **Utilizing Tags**

Within the Members page, you can easily create Tags to identify and group certain members of your community. For example, if you wanted to view all of the founders in your community as a group, you could create a Tag called “Founder”, as shown below.

Once you’ve created a Tag, you can apply it to certain users by navigating to the “Users” tab at the top of the Tag Manager. From here, you can easily hit the “+” next to any user and select the tag that you would like to apply.

## **Pending Tab**

This tab includes members who have joined via an onboarding form (in the case that the admin has selected “***I will manually approve them***” seen in the general settings) or been uploaded from a third party source (e.g. Zapier). 

Members can be in the pending tab for 2 reasons:

- The member joined via the onboarding form created by the admin and “manually approve members” was toggled on in the general settings page.
- The admin uploaded the members.

Things you can do in the Pending tab:

- Approve the member (by clicking the check mark on the actions). The member will then be marked as active.
- Delete a member (then they will be marked as inactive).

---

## **Inactive Tab**

In this tab, you will see the members who are inactive. 

---

## **Filters**

Finally, you can utilize the “Filters” tab to sort Members by:

- Tags (e.g. “Founder”)
- Questions
