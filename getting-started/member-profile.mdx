Welcome to the Member Profile page, where you can choose what data to collect from your members as well as customize your onboarding form questions.

---
You can use both the **"Basics"** and the **"Additional"** tabs to determine what data to collect from your members. 

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basics">
    Under the "Basics" tab, you can toggle between on and off for any of the basic information that you would like to collect from members during onboarding, including: Email, First / Last Name, Bio, Location, Job Title, etc. 
    
    <Note>
    **Note:** Make sure to toggle on any data that you already have from members so that it will map to the appropriate field when you upload / invite them to join. 
    </Note>
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Additional">
   Under the "Additional" tab, you have the option to customize your onboarding questions further to ensure that you are gathering the most relevant data from your members for matching purposes.

   You can do so by clicking on "+ Add a Question" and choosing a question type. For example, you may select a "Give and Take" type of question e.g. "What unique skills or knowledge can you offer to others?" and "What areas are you hoping to develop or learn more about?"
