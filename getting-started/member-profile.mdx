Welcome to the Member Profile page, where you can choose what data to collect from your members as well as customize your onboarding form questions.

---
You can use both the **"Basics"** and the **"Additional"** tabs to determine what data to collect from your members. 

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basics">
    Under the "Basics" tab, you can toggle between on and off for any of the basic information that you would like to collect from members during onboarding, including: Email, First / Last Name, Bio, Location, Job Title, etc. 
    
    <Note>
    **Note:** Make sure to toggle on any data that you already have from members so that it will map to the appropriate field when you upload / invite them to join. 
    </Note>
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Additional">
   Under the "Additional" tab, you can further customize your onboarding questions to gather the most relevant data for member matching. Simply click "+ Add a Question" and choose a question type.

  For instance, you might select the "Give and Take" option and ask, "What unique skills or knowledge can you offer others?" and "What areas are you looking to develop or learn more about?" This will help create more personalized matches based on similar responses.
