Welcome to the Member Profile page, where you can choose what data to collect from your members as well as customize your onboarding form questions.

You can use both the **"Basics"** and **"Additional"** tabs to determine what data to collect from your members. 

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basics">
    In the "Basics" tab, you can toggle on or off the basic information you'd like to collect from members during onboarding, such as email, first/last name, bio, location, job title, and more.
 
    
    <Note>
    **Note:** If you already have the data, make sure to toggle it on so it maps to the right fields when you upload or invite members.
    </Note>
    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Additional">
   Under the "Additional" tab, you can further customize your onboarding questions to gather the most relevant data for member matching. Simply click "+ Add a Question" and choose a question type.  

    <Note>
    **Note:** You can also map specific data to these questions when you upload / invite members.
    </Note>

  For instance, you might select the "Give and Take" option and ask, "What unique skills or knowledge can you offer others?" and "What areas are you looking to develop or learn more about?" This will help create more personalized matches based on similar responses.
