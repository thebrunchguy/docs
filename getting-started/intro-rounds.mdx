 **Scheduling Intro Rounds**

    Schedule your Intro Round invitations with ease! Select the date and time, customize calendar invites, and choose how your Members can schedule. You can also set up recurring rounds on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, with flexible invitation options: opt-in, opt-out, or neither.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Flow">

Customize the Member experience with one of these flows:

> **Opt-In Flow:** Ideal for larger communities with varying levels of Member engagement, or if you'd prefer that Members should choose to opt-in for introductions. For example, selecting the Opt-In with Scheduling option, you can control when the opt-in message is sent and when the intro and scheduling link are delivered, followed by the Members coordinating a time to meet and then receiving their feedback submission once the intro takes place.

> **Opt-Out Flow:** Perfect for smaller or private communities with higher engagement, or if you'd prefer that Members are automatically opted-in, but can choose to opt-out. For instance, selecting the Opt-Out and No Scheduling option, Members receive an intro without a scheduling link and can coordinate their meeting independently, providing feedback afterward.

> **No Opt-In/Opt-Out Flow:** Best suited for events where all Members are expected to participate, or if you'd prefer that no opt-in or opt-out messages are sent. When at an event, you can pre-set meeting times to avoid confusion, ensuring all Members know when to meet.
