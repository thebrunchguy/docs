 **Scheduling Intro Rounds**

    Schedule your Intro Round invitations with ease! Select the date and time, customize calendar invites, and choose how your Members can schedule. You can also set up recurring rounds on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, with flexible invitation options: opt-in, opt-out, or neither.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Flow">

Customize the Member experience with one of these flows:

<Accordion title="Opt-In Flow">

> Ideal for larger communities with varying levels of Member engagement, or if you'd prefer that Members should choose to opt-in for introductions. 

>For example, selecting the Opt-In with Scheduling option, you can control when the opt-in message is sent and when the intro and scheduling link are delivered, followed by the Members coordinating a time to meet and then providing their feedback once the intro takes place.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Opt-Out Flow">

> Perfect for smaller or private communities with higher engagement, or if you'd prefer that Members are automatically opted-in, but can choose to opt-out. 

>For instance, selecting the Opt-Out and No Scheduling option, Members receive an intro without a scheduling link and can coordinate their meeting independently, providing feedback afterward.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Opt-In/Opt-Out Flow">

> Best suited for events where all Members are expected to participate, or if you'd prefer that no opt-in or opt-out messages are sent. 

> For example, if you are at an event, you can pre-set meeting times to avoid confusion, ensuring all Members know when to meet.
</Accordion>
 </Step>
  <Step title="Matching Rules">

  Once your invitations are customized, you can implement matching rules. These rules are based on the custom questions Members answered during onboarding. You can match Members based on similarity, within or across sub-groups, or create entirely custom rules. Additionally, you can rank the importance of each matching criterion to optimize the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.

<Accordion title="Tag Rules">
  > Define relationships between tags, such as must match, cannot match, or can self-match, to fine-tune your matching strategy.
  </Accordion>
   </Step>
    <Step title="Matches">

    After setting up your invites and matching rules, you'll see a list of all potential matches. Lock in these matches and customize your introductions further as needed.
     </Step>
      <Step title="Messaging">

      Next, personalize the emails that will be sent to each Member before they receive their invitation to join the Intro Round. You can also further customize these emails in the Channels tab under Email, where you will find all of the email templates e.g. Introduction, Opt-In, Opt-Out, etc. 
        </Step>
        <Step title="Feedback">
        Once Members have connected, they will provide feedback on their experience, helping us continually refine and enhance the process. You can also further refine the Feedback Form in the Customization tab.
