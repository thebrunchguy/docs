 ### **Scheduling Intro Rounds**

    Schedule your Intro Round invitations with ease! Select the date and time, customize calendar invites, and choose how your members can schedule. You can also set up recurring rounds on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis, with flexible invitation options: opt-in, opt-out, or neither.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Flow">

Customize the member experience with one of these flows:

<Accordion title="Opt-In Flow">

> Ideal for larger communities with varying levels of member engagement, or if you'd prefer that members should choose to opt-in for introductions. 

>For example, selecting the "Opt-In with Scheduling" option, you can control when the opt-in message is sent and when the intro and scheduling link are delivered, followed by the members coordinating a time to meet and then providing their feedback once the intro takes place.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Opt-Out Flow">

> Perfect for smaller or private communities with higher engagement, or if you'd prefer that members are automatically opted-in, but can choose to opt-out. 

>For instance, selecting the "Opt-Out and No Scheduling" option, Members receive an intro without a scheduling link and can coordinate their meeting independently, providing feedback afterward.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Opt-In/Opt-Out Flow">

> Best suited for events where all members are expected to participate, or if you'd prefer that no opt-in or opt-out messages are sent. 

> For example, if you are at an event, you can pre-set meeting times to avoid confusion, ensuring all members know when to meet.
</Accordion>
 </Step>
  <Step title="Matching Rules">

  Once your invitations are customized, you can implement matching rules. These rules are based on the custom questions members answered during onboarding. You can match members based on similarity, within or across sub-groups, or create entirely custom rules. Additionally, you can rank the importance of each matching criterion to optimize the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.

   <Note>
    **Note:** Tag Rules help you define relationships between tags, such as must match, cannot match, or can self-match, to fine-tune your matching strategy.
    </Note>

<Accordion title="Match on Similarity">
  > When members indicate their weekend activity preferences, "Match on Similarity" pairs them based on shared interests. For example:

> Member 1 enjoys hiking and cooking.

> Member 2 also enjoys hiking and cooking.

> Member 3 loves cooking and is interested in photography.

The system might match Member 1 with Member 2 due to shared hiking and cooking interests, or pair Member 2 with Member 3 for their mutual love of cooking and another shared activity (hiking or photography). This approach fosters connections by aligning members with similar preferences, increasing the likelihood of enjoyable interactions.
  </Accordion>
   </Step>
    <Step title="Matches">

    After setting up your invites and matching rules, you'll see a list of all potential matches. Lock in these matches and customize your introductions further as needed.
     </Step>
      <Step title="Messaging">

      Next, personalize the emails that will be sent to each Member before they receive their invitation to join the Intro Round. You can also further customize these emails in the Channels tab under Email, where you will find all of the email templates e.g. Introduction, Opt-In, Opt-Out, etc. 
        </Step>
        <Step title="Feedback">
        Once Members have connected, they will provide feedback on their experience, helping us to continually refine and enhance the process. You can also further refine the Feedback Form in the Customization tab.

### **Matching Rules**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Match on Similarity">

    Imagine you have a group of members who have indicated their preferences for weekend activities:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Member 1: Loves hiking, enjoys reading, interested in cooking
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Member 2: Enjoys hiking, loves cooking, interested in photography
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Member 3: Loves photography, enjoys cooking, interested in hiking
      </Step>
    </Steps>

In this case, "Match on Similarity" means that the system will pair members based on how closely their preferences align. For example:

Member 1 might be matched with Member 2 because they both enjoy hiking and have an interest in cooking. Member 2 could also be matched with Member 3 since they both love cooking and have an interest in another shared activity (hiking for Member 2 and photography for Member 3).

This way, members are paired with others who have similar interests, making it more likely that they'll enjoy their time together and form meaningful connections.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Match with Sub-Groups">
   
   Imagine you have a sub-group of members who are interested in a specific hobby:

   First Tag: Photography Enthusiasts

<Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 1: Amateur Photographer
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
      Answer Response 2: Professional Photographer
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 3: Photography Student
      </Step>
    </Steps>

   Rule: Must Match

In this scenario, the rule "Must Match" means that members within the "Photography Enthusiasts" sub-group will be matched with each other based on their level of experience or interest in photography. So, an amateur photographer might be paired with a photography student to share tips and learn from each other, while professional photographers can connect to discuss advanced techniques and industry insights. 

This ensures that members are matched with others who share their specific interest, fostering more meaningful and relevant connections.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Match across Sub-Groups">
    Imagine you have two sub-groups of alumni based on their graduation years:

   First Tag: Cohort 2010

<Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 1: Graduated in 2010
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 2: Interested in Networking
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
         Answer Response 3: Lives in New York
      </Step>
    </Steps>

   Second Tag: Cohort 2015

<Steps>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 1: Graduated in 2015
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
        Answer Response 2: Interested in Mentorship
      </Step>
      <Step title="">
         Answer Response 3: Lives in San Francisco
      </Step>
    </Steps>

   Rule: Can Not Match

In this case, the rule "Can Not Match" means that members from Cohort 2010 will not be matched with members from Cohort 2015 based on their graduation year. However, they could still be matched based on other criteria, such as their interest in networking or mentorship, or their location. 

This allows for cross-cohort connections while still respecting the boundaries of each graduation year.
