  <Tab title="Matching Rules">
    Under **Matching Rules**, you can customize the matching rules that you also see when you schedule an Intro Round. You can head to the Intro Rounds section within the documentation to learn about the various matching and tag rules.

    For example, you can implement rules such as matching on similarity, with sub-groups or across sub-groups and assign weights to each.

  You also can add custom tag rules e.g. NYC member must match with another NYC member.

  <Tab title="Feedback Form">
    Here, you can see the Feedback Form that will be sent to members after Intros have been completed. It will collect information such as       match fit, key takeaways from the conversation, and interest in reconnecting. You can also add custom questions to the form.

    The feedback form is important for the Intros AI team to better understand how we can better serve users and improve their overall           experience.
