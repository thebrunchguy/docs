### **Customization FAQs**

#### **Matching Rules**

- **Question:** "Which Matching Rules should I use?"
    - **Answer:** "We recommend using ‘Matching on Similarity’ for most questions, but you can explore different options under ‘Matching Rules’ on the [Intro Rounds](https://docs.intros.ai/getting-started/intro-rounds) page to understand the benefits of each."
- **Question:** "Can you add location to Matching Rules?"
    - **Answer:** "Yes! Using Tags, you can create location-specific tags, apply them to members, and then use ‘Tag Rules’ to match members based on their location in an Intro Round."
- **Question:** "Is there a way to create custom matching criteria?"
    - **Answer:** "While we are working on more advanced matching capabilities, at present, the platform supports native options for matching. More customization options are planned for future releases."

#### **Onboarding Form**

1. **Question:** "Does someone need to fill out the onboarding form to be searchable? Can others request a match if a member hasn’t completed the form?"
    - **Answer:** "No, a member doesn’t need to fill out the onboarding form to be searchable. Other members can request a match even if the form isn't filled out. If you prefer members to be searchable without filling out information themselves, admins can upload their details via CSV or CRM integration instead."
