Welcome to the Customization page, where you can customize Matching Rules along with the Onboarding and Feedback Forms.

  <Tab title="Matching Rules">
    Under **Matching Rules**, you can customize the matching rules that you also see when you schedule an Intro Round. You can head to the Intro Rounds section within the documentation to learn about the various matching and tag rules.

    For example, you can implement rules such as matching on similarity, with sub-groups or across sub-groups and assign weights to each.

  <Tab title="Feedback Form">
    Under **Feedback Form**, you can view and customize the Feedback Form that your members will receive after they have an interaction during an Intro Round. The form will collect information such as match fit, key takeaways from the conversation, and interest in reconnecting. You can also add custom questions to the form.

    <Note>
    **Note:** The feedback form is important for the Intros AI team to better understand how we can better serve members and improve their overall experience.
