  <Tab title="Feedback Form">
    Under **Feedback Form**, you can view and customize the Feedback Form that your members will receive after they have an interaction during an Intro Round. The form will collect information such as match fit, key takeaways from the conversation, and interest in reconnecting. You can also add custom questions to the form.

    <Note>
    **Note:** The feedback form is important for the Intros AI team to better understand how we can better serve members and improve their overall experience.
